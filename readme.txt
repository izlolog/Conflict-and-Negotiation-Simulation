The current version of the simulation uses the following files:

init.m
definitions.m
main.m
plotting.m
print2CommandLine.m
write2file.m

init.m: This is the primary function used to run the simulation on matlab command line. It prompts for initial conditions, then calls all other files listed above.
e.g. 
>> "init(100, 1, .5, .5, 1000, 100, .5, 15)"

definitions.m: initialize all variables in the simulation.

main.m: This is the main loop, which determines the result of the simulation.

plotting.m: plot results.

print2CommandLine.m: print desired results to matlab command line.

write2file.m: write results to .csv file, name specified in "init.m"


'e' = extremist or fringe leader
'ML' = main line leader
ctc = commitment to conflict
